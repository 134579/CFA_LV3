Question 3
A:
	√ discount rate will reduce from 7% to 6.5% in 2008. so pbo will increase in 2008
	
B:
	√ total return objective of penson asset in 2007 = 
		7% + 2.5% = 9.5%
	** and total return objective will remain unchanged in 2008
	√ excess return of pension asset ** in 2008 **= 
		9.5% - 6.5% = 3%

C:
	minimization of shortfall risk

D:
	i:
		√ sponsor's debt/asset ratio > industry's debt/asset ratio, indicates TEPP below average ability to take risk
	ii:
		√ TEPP is underfunded, and the shortfall is larger than industry average, indicate TEPP is below average ability to take risk
	iii:
		√ TEPP allows early retirement and lump sum payments, which most U.S airlines don't allow. this indicate  TEPP has below average ability to take risk 
	iiii:
		√ average age of TEPP paricipants is 47, and is above industry average, indicate shorter time horizen and higher liquidity needs, which indicates below average ability to take risk
E:
	√ liquidity needs in 2008 = 
		benefit - contribution = 1030 million - 927 million
							   = 103 million

F:

		** so active-lives portions is more inflation sensitive
		** reading 14, 不考
	ii:
		√ duration is higher in active-lives portions because they have longer time horizen
G:
	barrows:
		√ TEPP should be ALM(asset liability matching), and equity doesn't match this rule
		** changes in equity values will not match change in pension liability
	tate:
		× TEPP is currently underfunded, so required return of fund asset must be higher than risk free rate
		*** √
		** TEPP should be ALM, and changes in risk free securities is not correlated with pension liability
		*** 原来的解答也对
