1. 机构分类
	1. pension(最重要)
		主要是DB plan,
		DC plan和个人IPS有关, 因为是个人决定投资什么
	2. charitable bodies(第二重要)
		foundation endowment
	3. insurance
		life insurance(第三重要)
		non-life insurance
	4. bank


2. pension概念
	1. sponsor: employer
	2. partcipant: employee
	3. DC, DB difference
		DC:
			1. employer only obligation is to make contribution
			2. employee owns assets, make investment decision
			3. contribution is regarded as expense
			4. 分类
				1. sponsor direct
					只有一种ESOP
				2. partcipant direct
					其他DC都属于participant direct, partcipant make investment decision
		DB:
			1. employer manage the plan and bear investment risk
			2. pension plan is regarded as liability
	4. ESOP
		employee sotck ownership plan: 员工持股计划吗, 本质是DC, 投资的是本公司股票
		1. 特点:
			1. 风险高, 因为employee的human capital and financial capital correlation high
			2. 优点:
				1. 让库存股流动性增加
				2. avoid ipo
				3. fend off hostile takeovers
	
	5. DB plan:
		1. funded status:
			funded status = PV of pension fund - PBO(pv of pension liability)
			funded status > 0 => overfunded
			              < 0 => underfunded
	
	6. ALM, AO
		1. asset liability matching:
			1. 特点
				1. 资产与负债的波动匹配, 相关性高的策略
				2. 不追求asset的最大收益
				3. 要求负债增加时资产也要增加, 负债减少时资产减少
				4. 在负债很重要(contractual liability)(如养老金)时采用
				5. 要求asset cover liability
				
		2. asset only: 只有资产, 要求投资组合达到optimal portfolio
		
	7. ABO, PBO
		1. current wage
		2. future wage growth
		3. new employees
		4. benefit change
		ABO 只考虑 current wage
		PBO 考虑 current wage and future wage growth
		total future liablity 考虑所有
		
	8. funding rate
		funding rate = pension asset/ pension liability
3. rrttllu
	1. return
		1. objective
			1. cover pension liability(总是可以写)
			*2. if funded status < 0 , may require high return
			*3. minimize contribution
			*4. maybe higher return is required if sponsor is trying to lower future contribution
			1一定有, 2,3,4可能有
			
			
		2. 计算
			1. overfunded, PV_a > PV_l
				Δfs = asset * r + contribution - benefit - ΔPBO = 0
				required return = liability discount rate
			2. underfunded
				required return = liability discount rate + excess return(题目中会给)
			
	2. risk tolerance
		只有ability, 没有willingness
		1. ability
			1. 和其他foundation比
				低, 因为是alm的
			2. 和其他DB比(重点)
				1. plan status
					overfunded => ability ↑
				2. sponsor financial status
					debt ratio ↓ => ability ↑
					currency ↑ => ability ↑
				3. common risk exposure between sponsor operating and pension asset
					ρ ↓ => ability ↑
				4. plan feature
					early retirement allowed => liquidity needs ↑ => ability ↓
					lump sum distribution(大额支取) => liquidity needs ↑, time horizen ↓ => ability ↓
				5. workforce
					younger worker ↓ => liquidity needs ↓, time horizen ↑ => ability ↑
				6. going concern(新员工可以加入)
					going concern => younger workers => ability ↑
	3. risk objective
		1. minimization of shortfall risk(总是可以写)
		2. obtain certain level of funding status
		
	4. liquidity
		1. 定性
			1. workforce age
				↓ => liquidity needs ↓
			2. sponsor contribution - benefit payment
				↑ => liquidity needs ↓
			3. going concern
				=> workforce age ↓ => liquidity needs ↓
			4. early retirement
				=> liquidity needs ↑
			5. lump sum payment
				=> liquidity needs ↑
		2. 计算
			liquidity needs this year= contribution - benefit
	
	5. time horizen
		1. going concern
			=> time horizen ↑
		2. 不一定是multi-stage
