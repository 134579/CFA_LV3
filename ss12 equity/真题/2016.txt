Question 3
A:
	IR = E(Rp - Rb)/ σ(Rp - Rb)
	E(Rp - Rb) = (20% * 2.3% + 25% * 3.5%) = 1.335%
	σ(Rp - Rb) = sqrt(var(Rp - Rb))
	σ(Rp - Rb) = sqrt( 20%^2 * 4%^2 + 25%^2*8%^2 ), because correlation between euro largecap growth  and emerging market is 0
			   = 215.40%%
			   
	IR = 1.335%/215.4%% = 0.6198

B:
	i:
		ret based:	the style weight of euro large cap growth fall from 85% to now 58%, indicating this mandate deviates from large cap style
		holding based: the mandate hold only 33% of top quantile sorted by cap, and the benchmark is 45%. so this mandate hold far less large cap equities than benchmark
	ii:
		ret based: the mandate hold a total of 85+5=90% large/small cap growth in the past and 58+32=90% currently. so its growing style doesn't change.
		holding based:	the mandate's holding has higher P/E,P/B ratio, low didvend yield than benchmark
			these are characteristic of growth stock.
			
C:
	×most appropriate:
		ara short extension
		
	×1. short extension strategy don't change β compared with simple long strategy
