portfolio A, before tax return r = 10%
return = 10%
	- interest tax, percentage Pi, tax Ti
	- divdend tax, percentage Pd, tax Td
	- realized capital gain, percentage Pcg, tax Tcg
	*unrealized capital gain, 当年不交税, 所以还会compound
	
after tax return r_art
	= r - Pi*Ti - Pd*Td - Prcg *Trcg

defered capital gain tax
	= [(1+r_art)^n - B] * Tecg

Pucg = 1 - Pi - Pd - Prcg
Tcg * Pucg = Tecg * (1 - Pi*Ti - Pd*Td - Prcg *Trcg)
