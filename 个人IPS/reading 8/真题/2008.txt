		i:
			√ cover mortgage
			√ get income comparable to their salary after they retire
			** 这一句话总能写
			** maintain inflation adjusted value of their portfolio
		ii:
			t=0:
				tia = cash inflow - cash outflow
					= 500k + 1500k * 50% - 850k * 30%
					= 995k
				** 即使能抵消也要写全
				** 写出明细科目
				** tia = cash inflow - cash outflow
				**	   = short term deposit + half the value of trust + salary - (living expense + down payment)
					   
			t=1:
				cash flow needs = cash outflow - cash inflow
								= living expense + mortgage - salary
								= 55k
				** cash flow needs = cash outflow - cash inflow
								   = (mortgage + living expense) - salary
			after tax nominal rate of return 
				= 55/995 + 4%
				= 5.527% + 4%
				= 9.527%
